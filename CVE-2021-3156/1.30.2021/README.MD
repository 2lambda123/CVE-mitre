- - - A different experience from `stong` :)

# Instructions

1. wget/curl

2. tune RACE_SLEEP_TIME

3. gcc exploit.c

4. cp /etc/passwd fakepasswd
- - - and `cp /etc/passwd passwd_original` because you can break your system
- - - ***WARNING:*** After exploit the system, you must execute `cp /etc/passwd_original /etc/passwd` because you must restore your system and rights!

5. modify fakepasswd so your uid is 0

6. ./a.out

7. Normal login with your user, in my test case the password is `password` and then you should execute `id`, to see who are you =)

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 (sudo 1.8.21p2) and 20.04 (1.8.31)

this bug freaking sucked to PoC, it took like 3 sisyphean days and then suddenly today I just got insanely lucky
