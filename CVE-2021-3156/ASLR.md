What is ASLR?
Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a memory protection techniques that tries to prevent an attacker from creating a reliable exploit. What it does is simple, a binary is loaded at a different base address in memory upon restart (or reboot for OS dlls). It also randomizes the base addresses for memory segments like the heap and the stack. This makes it harder for attackers to guess the correct address.

ASLR was introduced in Windows Vista and is in all newer versions. To make use of it, the executable needs to be compiled with /DYNAMICBASE option as well. OS dlls have that by default.

A way to see this taking place is by attaching an executable supporting ASLR (WinRAR in example below). Attach it to OllyDbg and go to the memory tab (ALT+M).

How does it make exploitation harder?
Most exploits require a way to redirect execution to the payload, this can be done by many different ways. What all these techniques got in common is finding an instruction that will “trigger” the payload by jumping to the address. Since addresses are hard coded they won’t work after restart/reboot/different machine.

```
Example: A JMP ESP instruction is located at 0x12345678 in test.dll, upon restart, address is now located at 0xABCD5678.
```
