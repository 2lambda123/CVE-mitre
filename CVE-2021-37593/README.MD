## CVE-2021-37593-[CSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/tokens)

### Issue detail:
The request appears to be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against unauthenticated functionality. This is unlikely to constitute a security vulnerability in its own right, however it may facilitate exploitation of other vulnerabilities affecting application users.  The original request contains parameters that look like they may be anti-CSRF tokens. 
However the request is successful if these parameters are removed.
