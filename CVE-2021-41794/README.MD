- Summary
When connecting to the UPF port for the PFCP protocol (8805) and sending an Association Setup Request followed by a Session Establishment Request with a PDI Network Instance set to ‘internet’, it causes a stack corruption to occur.


- Impact
Exploitation of this vulnerability would lead to denial of service for the subscriber’s equipment.

- Details
Sending a PFCP Association Setup followed by a PFCP Session Establishment Request with the settings detailed below is enough to cause the stack overflow.  The issue is caused by the function ogs_fqdn_parse in the file lib/core/ogs-3gpp-types.c calculating a length value used in a memcpy without validating it.
