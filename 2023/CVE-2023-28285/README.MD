## Description:
The attack itself is carried out locally by a user with authentication to the targeted system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a victim, through social engineering, to download and open a specially crafted file from a website which could lead to a local attack on the victim's computer. The attacker can trick the victim to open a malicious web page by using a malicious `Word` file for `Office-365 API`. After the user will open the file to read it, from the API of Office-365, without being asked what it wants to activate, etc, he will activate the code of the malicious server, which he will inject himself, from this malicious server. Emedietly after this click, the attacker can receive very sensitive information! For bank accounts, logs from some sniff attacks, tracking of all the traffic of the victim without stopping, and more malicious stuff, it depends on the scenario and etc.
