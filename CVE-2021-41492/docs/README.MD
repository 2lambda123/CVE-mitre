## Description:
The username parameter from `Sourcecodester Simple Cashiering System (POS) 1.0 ` appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A single quote was submitted in the username parameter, and a general error message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. The attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database for all users, and also administrator account!
